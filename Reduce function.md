# Reduce function
Function to combine 2 elements in collection to a single element.

## Challenge
- Time needed for data movement
- Network [[Bandwidth]] consumption
- Interfacing memory with disk
    - The amount of memory used to process the data is huge and there would be a need to store partial data into [[Backing store]]

## Overcoming
- Local reduction before global reduction to reduce overhead across [[Node]]s.
